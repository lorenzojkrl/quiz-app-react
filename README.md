# Quiz App React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Demo
This project is available online at https://quiz-app-jkrl.herokuapp.com/ \
Note that the first time you open the app in Heroku it may take a few seconds to load.\
This is due to the fact that when the app is unused for a while it gets unloaded from the server memory.\
There is an [official note](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#dyno-sleeping) about this.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run server`
Runs the json server to make db.json available in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001/questions](http://localhost:3001/questions) to view it in the browser.

### Improvements
<ul>
  <li>Move data to MongoDB</li>
  <li>Show Q&A to user after each round</li>
  <li>The same question shouldn't be asked in the same round</li>
</ul>
